Introducing EFPSE Scripter: Your Essential Tool for Script and FSM Creation 

An HTML page designed to streamline your script and FSM file management. Whether you're creating, opening, saving, or editing, this tool allows you to do it all. 

Download and "install" instructions. 
Simply download the HTML document and open it with your web browser then you are ready to go!

Currently, in its alpha build, EFPSE Scripter promises much more to come, making it an indispensable asset for developers seeking efficiency and convenience. 

You can download it here for free or on itch.io and you can access it directly on my website at http://pixelwolf.net.

The future
Future update plans are set to elevate your experience even further. Expect refined syntax highlighting, inclusion of any missed commands, and ongoing maintenance to align with engine updates. Additionally, watch for enhanced features like highlighted parameters in distinct colors, robust error handling, and convenient auto-completion.

Please bear in mind I have a full-time job, 2 small kids, and other personal projects that require attention so I will do my best to keep it up to date and add additional features.
